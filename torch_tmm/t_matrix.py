Module: t_matrix.py
================================================================================
Description:
    This module implements the T_matrix class for computing the transfer matrix in
    thin film optics using the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM). The T_matrix class
    provides methods to calculate the transfer matrix for a coherent layer,incoherent layer,
    and interfaces as well as for propagation inside a layer. All layers are homogeneous and
    isotropic.

    All theoretical foundations and mathematical details of the implemented methods
    are thoroughly discussed in the following references:

    In the current implementation, each coherent layer is treated independently from the others
    by introducing infinitesimally small air gaps between them. As a result, each layer is effectively
    surrounded by air, allowing its T-matrix to be computed in isolation. The environmental (top)
    and substrate (bottom) interfaces are added only at the final stage. While this approach simplifies
    certain computations, it introduces unnecessary interface calculations that may lead to error accumulation.
    **This design choice is subject to revision in future versions.**

    Matrix mutliplication procedure is implemented in model.py

    The implementation leverages a normalized wave-vector component (`nx`),
    perpendicular to the layer boundaries, instead of directly using the angle of incidence.
    This approach avoids dealing explicitly with complex-valued angles,
    particularly beneficial for scenarios involving total internal reflection.
    `nx` is computed once and consistently reused throughout the computation pipeline,
    enhancing both numerical stability and computational efficiency.

    Additionally, PyTorch’s square root operation is defined such that the imaginary part of the result
    is always non-negative, which helps avoid branch cut ambiguities.

    The methods in this module operate in a vectorized manner using
    PyTorch tensors, which facilitates high-performance computations on both CPU
    and GPU devices and compatible with automatic differentiation (autograd).

Key Components:
    - coherent_layer: Computes the transfer matrix for a single coherent
      layer surrounded by air over all wavelengths and angles.
    - interface_s: Computes the interface matrix between two media for s-polarization.
    - interface_p: Computes the interface matrix between two media for p-polarization.
    - propagation_coherent: Computes the propagation transfer matrix through a layer.

Conventions:
    - propagation from left to right
    - refractive index defined as n_real + 1j*n_imm
    - wavelenghts and thicknesses must be defined in nm
    - angles defined in degree in range [0, 90)

Usage:
    - in the case of very high absorption (alpha > 60) or total internal reflection
    (nz purely imaginary) computational errors can arise. To avoid this we implement
    the clamp-and-split trick threshold to avoid numerical instability.


Example:
    >>> import torch
    >>> from t_matrix import T_matrix
    >>> tm = T_matrix(dtype=torch.complex64, device=torch.device('cpu'))
    >>> # Define optical parameters
    >>> n = torch.tensor([1 + 1.5j])
    >>> d = torch.tensor([100e-9])
    >>> wavelengths = torch.tensor([500e-9, 600e-9])
    >>> incidence_angle = torch.tensor([0,30,60])
    >>> nx = n * torch.sin(incidence_angle)
    >>> T = tm.coherent_layer('s', n, d, wavelengths, nx)
    >>> print(T)
